Assignment:	3 - BMI Calculator


This app will take as input the users height and weight.  Once the 
Calculate button is pressed the app will read the inputs and calculate
the users BMI and display it to the screen.  

Use:
	launch app from xcode, build and run, the app will request for
	your height and weight, input the two fields and then the 
	calculate button will enable itsself so the user can
	click it to display the results.  
Bugs:
	-The app will disable the calculate button upon launch, 
	but the button will be enabled once the height and weight
	fields are filled in.  IF the user erased one of the inputs, 
	the calculate button will not disable itsself(i couldnt figure 
	out why).  Therefore clicking the button without filling in both
	fields will cause a crash.
